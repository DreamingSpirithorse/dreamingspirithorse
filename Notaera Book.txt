Sometimes it just takes a moment ~maybe a real smile ~perfectly timed ~to make someone's day.
~paradise

	I find raising creatures and raising myself not so different.  And every person, of any species, is an opportunity to create a gem.

when i cuddle with ilako, I'm not touching her because it makes me feel good ~I'm touching her because it makes her feel good ~which makes me feel good.

Happy dogs shake their spine when happy.  So happy dogs happier more times have healthier spines, are more fit ~and thus are happier dogs.

creatures bring themselves into harmony if the rest of their environment is in harmony

i believe ilako should do what i say, not because of fear nor repetitive training, but because she feels how I genuinely have her best interest at heart.
	
I think the only fair way to expect any of the creatures here to come when I signal to come...
is if I come when they signal me to come too.

How clearly and brilliantly she eventually communicates depends on how responsive I am to her signs.
If ilako does the tongue signal for 'tasty', I give her more of the food she says she likes.  ilako tunes her words with use and masters them and puts intricacies into them ~and it's up to me to respond correctly.  How correctly I respond, and to what level of detail, determines how complex she can make her language ~which determines how complex her thoughts can be.

	it doesn't matter what species listens ~i say what the food is called as we eat it because we all link the sound with the thing whether we can say the sound or not

Were I to do a class, age wouldn't matter at all ~it's the person that matters.
And it would be for infinite years.  Someone could be 80 and someone could be 5 and what matters is that they are here on purpose because they want to learn and grow ~they don't have to be pushed.  Everyone must be a good norm for the others.  All homework and tests as optional to participate in.  This is how I would raise a child and the only type of 'school' I would allow them in. Where everyone stands out and everyone stands together.

I have this unique extrabig apple so I'm going to share it with Samson (hog), Jodi (horse), and Darlin (horse) so we can all experience it.  I already know it's extrahealthy ~because the healthiest type of apple is the one for someone special~ given in love.

		the art of negative feedback
the art of positive feedback
and when you give them
~an artform people of all species show their individuality with
		
Giving someone the opportunity to be bad also gives them an opportunity to be good.
Because the food is in reach and she is able to hold herself back when I walk away, she is better than someone never given the option to take it.

Raise dogs so well they don't need to be around cats when young to automatically be good with cats.  Raise everything like this.

The healthiest type of apple is the one given with love.  :)

something you or someone you know cooks is a million times more special than something bought in a store ~no matter how it tastes

âœ¨Causing the most good with the least sufferingâœ¨

All the 'forcing people' stuff of the government which most hot topic's are based on come down to this.
There are good people that believe they shouldn't be forced in any way by the government ~and perhaps this is true.
There are also bad people that the force is proposed to deal with.
What should be happening is the quality of person of everyone should be increasing ~and force should be lessening ~to eventual total freedom with only good people.
There are people on both sides: those pushing for more freedom than people are ready for, and those pushing for more control than people need.  Both groups should balance each other with the underlying trend being an increase in person quality of all individuals and inherent lessening of force because of it.
~Sky Below
		
i find for myself that there isn't a me or them selfishness dichotomy.  I find there to always be a best way for myself AND others simultaneously ~and that this is the path that ~in my belief system~ I should walk.

I've got people to be and things to do.
And if you really want to change the world ~so do you!

I believe that all people are created unequal in most ways.
And that all people all places all species should be shown respect for the sacredness of their unique divine self.

If you are opening your proverbial mouth, it should be something healthy for you to say, for me to hear, for the energy of the universe ~and I will feel only more grown in a good way afterward.
		
i believe all people all places are ultimately united in a common destiny and that we all want our home ~our earth~ to be a better place. On some deep level. Bugs, birds, humans ~all people share this place, and to genuinely, really try, for the good of all, to make our home somewhere we can be proud of generates a symbiosis beyond species, nationality, any lines found along the surface of our beautiful world and the sacred thing we call life

I have ideals and purpose.  It is up to us to make the world we want to live in.
*
I would like to smoke weed and meditate and record my good thoughts and have it be just wonderful and not deal with any government stuff to do it.
I would like to turn my phone on and go to a webpage and not see any advertisements at all.  I would like to have a baseline of absolute good with nothing that makes me disgusted or lowers my mood at all.  I want humans to do things and create things because they love to ~not because money forces them to.  I want businesses to not worry about getting people to come back ~and just make what they are passionate about as best they can.
I want to care for the land I call home without having to constantly pay for it to avoid being swept away.  I don't want a sliding slope to scramble up forever.
I am worthy of somewhere I can be proud of ~and you are too.
There are basic rights we should all have ~but beyond that, there is A GOOD WORLD and we should have A GOOD WORLD.  We need to just get it into a state of BEING A GOOD WORLD ~and then we can do all these things we want to do.  No one should be content to retire, or rest at all, until our environment is something great.  I make music, and there's something very deep about the placement of notes ~it isn't that it takes a long time to make the perfect notes~ it's that it takes the perfect mindstate.  So I improve the quality of myself...  I improve the quality of my home ~my environment.  I improve the moods of the people I interact with ~of every species.  But I can only raise my thought quality so high ~so I can only make a song so good...
Because this planet around me isn't yet something I peek at and marvel at the wonders wherever I should turn my eyes.  I actually have to avert my eyes many places and not think about quite a few of the going on's of the world.  We need to fix the human machine.
We need to get to where people ~of every species, are happy.
We need somewhere better ~and it happens with us MAKING it better.	

May everyone be a better person because I interact with them.  May everywhere be a better place because I am there.

never waste an opportunity to brighten up someone's day
~paradise

i would like to only reinforce good qualities into myself and others

weed isn't an intoxicant ~because 'toxic' implies harm.

If I have leather shoes, it isn't for me to hate them.
I should love them and respect them and find them wonderful.
Because it isn't the shoes fault they were made in an immoral way.
Now that they exist; they do nothing wrong.
They don't deserve ill will.
I wouldn't want an entity disliking me because I am from an imperfect world.
It isn't my fault wherever my origin may be.
And same with the shoes.
They didn't kill the cow.
The shoes had no choice of their origin.
They had no choice the color of their skin.
They can be wonderful people.
They didn't pick 'boy' or 'girl' when they were born.
They didn't choose their parents nor their upbringing.
It isn't for me to hate and nor is it for anyone else.
There are things that people do in REAL LIFE that show who they really are.
And there are things they are born with that they had no control over.
Only one truly matters.

		diet should always be getting less harming and eventually into symbiosis
		
						incentives should be aligned with morality
		
i would use things like raspberries to color food instead of coal tar ~and cause health instead of cancer.

i dont consider a cow a food, nor do i consider any other person a food ~I think to do so would be disrespectful and not in the best interest of the person considered ~and they would much more prefer my actions and thoughts to be toward the improvement of conditions for them and myself in our beautiful shared reality.

  the most moral style of war is to not have war in the first place ~while maintaining and constantly growing better ability to defend our one united self as world.  No 'rules of war'.  War should never be acceptable and never happen.  and if we do have to go to war they need to get absolutely f@#ked to the point that every person in the world understands to never ever start a war.

and to humanity, crow said 'we love shiny things' and humanity littered the earth with them

pedantix
I find the farther I reach into directions of my own thought, the more I use specific words to denote(be a placeholder for) concepts that would otherwise be multiple words.  My commonly used words thus become more obscure and convey more multifaceted concepts.  This allows a single sentence to tell more and more of the topic and delve deeper and deeper.  Humans usually follow each other into topics and their words evolve in this way to become understandable to others within their topic around their same level ~yet beyond those who are not.

ants care for and milk aphids. of course they would never murder and eat the creatures they care for ~that would be sick.

i prefer for everyone to be in their own power and no one in need of me or each other ~and then interact with each other not out of neccessity, but because we prefer each other's company.
âœ¨â›°ï¸âœ¨
that the human system incentivizes performing a task for someone instead of empowering their ability to do it themself shows the backwards direction the human system pushes the slaves bound within.
~Seall

sometimes you just have to imagine your own thing so humans can't poison your connotations on it
~rele

if you were raised with no cultural influence at all and every time followed your very first feeling on things ~who would you be and where would your path travel? be this person

Some humans fall entirely into being other humans and no longer have a self they interact with and trust.  They bring in words of other humans to represent their own thoughts so much that they no longer have their own thoughts.  When asked something deep, their mind goes to the thoughts of the human they are representing.
 
humans are patchwerk combinations of other humans.  the sounds and images and even philosophical thoughts of a human are usually created by other humans with different paths and energies.

humans may be used for displaying the qualities you want and letting their knowledge of you feedback the self you want into yourself

  			humans are like ver(multiple) spigots connected to one watersource.
            The spigots may be shaped differently and make the water taste different
             ~but they are all from the same source.
			 
			 Apparently humans usually prefer fathers, but my favorite god relationships personally are 'close sister', 'space alien disconnected from human culture', 'magic fey spirit'.  I know some humans unpersonalize 'god' into 'source energy' and robots ~but I personally prefer the personal touch.  I actually only have one father figure in my entire pantheon and he isn't even mine.  He's the father of another deity.  I do have a plant god and a magic item god and they are both fun and unusual in a good way.  So how about you?  Most humans are binary into either fathers or nothing and i find it the weirdest thing.  Even if I only had one god I wouldn't have her be 'father' type.  Maybe it's just my personality tho! 🙂  So hi humans, why the 'fathers or nothing'?  Do you have anything else?  What's it like?
Oh and the love and playfulness of dog goddess makes reality fun.  Someone could have only my dog goddess influencing their reality and as the filter through which they receive events and they would just pure love it.  Imagine events instead of from a stern but loving father ~from a playful and absolutely loving dog yet smart.
So humans why do you do what you do and how can it possibly be interesting basically comparing dads continuously?
			 
			 

take off the packaging and label and advertising.
some things are better not influencing thought or the energy of an environment at all

i am amazed humans so easily have belief systems that reduce their own power to interpret the events of their reality.

There are images shared among humans with text "When you ___" and the image shows someone presenting an accentuated version of the emotional response.  The purpose of this is to train the 'correct according to the herd' responses to events of the same type as the event stated.  This allows multiple humans to unify their responses to stimuli of differing 'types' and form overall cohesive herd responses for the social animal that is humans.

i find america to be a place of colors and flags. Where if someone shares the same color, they are a friend, and if they do not, then they are a foe. And it doesn't so much matter the truth so much as how potent the data as a weapon.
*
i view the use of emotions in body language and tone in conversation with the intent to sway people as immoral ~and that it inherently clouds the truth ~which should be able to stand on it's own, with the reader then making their own conclusion.

I believe humans are creatures with highest potential and ability to manipulate their environment, but notoriously fight overall bad footprints because of the monetization of labor and not wanting to do paid jobs for free, such as increasing the property value of someone elses land.  And how free time is the colloseum of competing leisure activities seeking their own proliferation ~Instead of time to progress along the path one truly desires.  I would love to come along three stones and a little tree and sit with them and feel a certain energy and place everything where the flow of the universe would best have them be.  What wonders can we create?  How good can we make everything?  Nothing to do with behavioral pitfalls from the shoddy design of the human machine.

ha heres a fun introspection
just mumped my head on the corner of this wood thing ~but thank you humans~ someone had placed a comfy squishy thing on the corner.  So I automatically lovingly thought *"thank you humans"*
this is the cute part.  :)
i realize i wasn't like 'thx to the person who put this here'.
just in general humans designed the thing, harvest the plastic, built the thing, found the corner, distributed yhe item, and whooshed it all the way to here 'humans humand and it was good'.
So that I think is cute ~i wuv humans.
they are a great organism in some ways 

with humans nowadays,
everything is one of many.
everyone is one of many.
please retain sacredness within perspective

i am amazed that among humans and other species rape can even happen ~that in some, arousel ignores the emotional state of the one found attractive.

A primary artform of humans is the twisting of data to push an agenda.
~sky below

is it really a special sacred item to you if you leave the tag on?

I think it's amazing that it seems acceptable for human language to force speakers to divulge the gender of who they are talking about.  I as a language would not force my speakers to divulge any information; not race, not gender, not age, not anything else ~and then have accessible avenues to share any information the speaker desires with even custom tints and crosssensory connotations.
A real language should be:
nonforceful. nonlimiting. empowering.

If an environment is high quality, things of low quality feel out of place and tend to move ~unless they are worthy of rising with the tide.

if u take your data from humans, there's only so high that can be reached.
if you take your data from spirits, you can feedbackloop yourself forever higher.

words pick up more good connotations in a good culture with happier people

a powerful spiritual person believes themselves or intimately aligned guides to be the most powerful entity(ies) in the cosmos.  a polite spiritual person does so without excluding nor limiting others.
				  
I speak echoes of it, but without directly sharing my belief system, except for the parts that reinforce or healthily expand yours.  So I, in our shared reality, forfeit none of my power to accomodate holding our shared reality true to your belief system.

so i put him into a song, but thats just level 1 soul collecting

my subconscious saw that piece long ago, and knew about it even before seeing it.
So of course i feel to walk to it at the perfect time

the more often you noticeably improve your reality ~the stronger your pattern of 'noticeably improving your reality'.
only good things make patterns.

only good things make patterns

when i move a note instead of delete it, i symbolize how i respect life and don't kill and instead find better places for things.  When i delete a note, i symbolize something that isn't the opposite and has nothing to do with death at all.

there are times to do what u first feel and times to push yourself

personify me with good attributes only ~thank you
 
  if a friend has a healthy event for their belief path and you don't believe it, pretend your best to believe it ~believe it happened for them in their reality.
 
 in interacting with me, it becomes clear I have mental processes for 'divine path' ~calculating everything in relation to divine path

hold unerringly to the best interpretation of the prophecy and you will only get the best interpretation of the prophecy
 Prophecies usually come in symbolism ~and symbolism interacts with personal interpretation.
 It's up to me what these events are that the dream* the prophecy came from refers to.
 So if I hold to belief only in the outcome I desire ~it is the only outcome with spiritual significance to attain.
 So if I maintain** the spiritual significance of events in my reality ^which depends on me maintaining** a high spiritual state^
    the only purpose and result of the prophecy is this one thing I choose ~which is at it's base good, and then as good as I can make it.  and this is the only direction being pushed with subconscious micromanipulations of actions to result in the path reality takes and resulting experiences and symbolism.
I usually then find the result isn't the exact thing I had in mind, but something equivalent in how much I like it and the symbolism ~so I accept it as the fulfillment of the prophecy and am thankful! 🙂
If I really like it ~i interpret the symbolism as starting a pattern

place the heartstone in the 'on its side' bucket and spin it so it could be pointing to all of us 

Everything helps you if you believe it does
:)

subconscious brought you somewhere? wonder why :)

to try to weaken the faith and divine guidance of others is a disrespectful act of enemies ~not symbiotic entities mutually trying to grow and support each other's growth.  If I ever critique someone's belief system, part of what should make them unique, it is to strengthen it and push it in a positive direction with new doors open.

				 								from a later step
                                see why you did the earlier step

you are here because there is a treasure to gather on your divine path

every spirit within and of you should be supporting you

how do you return to dreams you like?

		what if u see a version of wonderwoman with her friends all living happily forever in her patterns
		and can imagine her in your mind doing something
		see her do something in a dream
		ask yourself 'what would she do?' and do it.
		Somewhere in your mind, she is represented as is what she would do

i only place my own deities in power roles in my own reality

however dark they ever are
all my energy is good all i do is good all i think is good Â¥fate
all as neccessary steps to reach where i need to be

		i would like to be proud of myself and my home.
I would like to be proud of my friends and I would like to be proud of my world.
And have every one of these things be worthy of what adoration it receives.
I acknowledge my role in creating the reality I choose.
May this be my reality.
 may everywhere i turn my gaze become a gem
  May my presence be desired
  May I always protect myself and those who cannot protect themselves
  May I be worthy of all I ever gain
  and May every step be forward
  in this beautiful. good. world.

different items have different levels of magicalness ~they raise spirit level of the total environment by different measureable amounts.  A ring of harmoniusly placed crystals and colorful stones raises environmental spirit level more than a blank tshirt.  :)

Title dreams to give them identities
	
		My actions blatantly incorporate perfect knowledge of the future ~every level of detail~ and perfect incorporation of access to ALL data of reality.

in five minutes ~you can change the energy of an area forever

It's the energy first of 'YOU ARE HEALED' and then reality flows to accomodate the energy with whatever path allows the energy it's course.

unlike videogame characters, gods and spirits don't have to be balanced.

i think it's cute when I'm doing something with someone and to them they are just doing their normal stuff ~while I am seeing everything we are doing in symbolism and learning what their future and the future of our relationship is.

Imagine reaching a level of following feeling to perfect 'speaking in tongues' and just saying impossible_to_know things straight from the void.  I think it would be best as a flavorable ability that maintains the identity of the wielder.

could you paint the sky one star at a time?
i could

i only feel strongly about things :)

undersranding kanguage to to the point thqt i am comforrable with whatever i do

						I believe it is important to generate at least one high quality thing per day so I am sure my forward progress is constantly large as a minimum.

not just an app to send a message but an experience to convey an ideal.

master artist creates with great potency and thus is always attentive to patterns and energy types
		
				   		  when two songs reach the level that i listen to one to reach the mindstate to add to the other

I should be able to create a masterpiece in a place of any quality.  But the best creations still come from the best environment.

Considering recording vocals but deciding not to is better than not being able to.

All pieces are multimedium to start ~and narrowed down from infinity.

I find when I push myself and achieve what I really should, I wonder, can I keep this pace?  And then I just now make Underworld and the quality of this song is just omfg ~and i realize yes.  Song isn't even a word for Underworld.  There is no human word for Underworld.  When I am really holding to my potential, I find my energy to be not exhaustion but greatness beyond all to come before.

			 It isn't that it takes a long time to input the perfect notes ~It's that it takes the perfect mind state to input the perfect notes.

interpretting balance allows me to create complex stories with symbolism and keep the patterns pure good whether they go up, down, and whatever tone's they become ~so i only build good patterns into myself while deep into the design process of a song.
Like only identifying with a character when sure only good things happen to them.
I only build good patterns into myself.

choose a tool with high potential, and get to the point that you enjoy what you create.

i believe I should make the path better not just the first time i walk it ~but every time.

When I make an epic intro to a song ~the resulting song is epic cuz the rest only feels correct while making it if it matches|excedes the epicness of the start.

some people dont just do the minimum, and when they make something, all the little choices they make are windows into who they are.
